# Sales-Prediction

## Description

Black Friday is a colloquial term for the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season in the United States. Many stores offer highly promoted sales at discounted prices and often open early, sometimes as early as midnight or even on Thanksgiving. Some stores' sales continue to Monday ("Cyber Monday") or for a week ("Cyber Week").
The main challenge for a retail store or e-commerce business is to choose product prices in order to maximize profits at the end of the sale. This project mainly deals with determining product prices based on historical retail store sales data. After generating forecasts, retail stores can decide the price of their products in order to gain more profit.
